> Term project for Group #7 (Team NeuroSoftware) in CMPT 275: Software Engineering I

## Description

Alzheimer’s is a disease that effects not only the patient but everyone who is close to them. You may find yourself worried that your family members might one day forget where they live and wonder off. In fact, 6/10 people will wonder off and get lost! [[1]](http://www.alz.org/care/alzheimers-dementia-wandering.asp) Or maybe you are worried that they are taking too many trips to the pharmacy buying over the counter drugs or the casino spending their money and not remembering how much they lost. While you may not always be able to be by their side, with *Safety Beacon* you can rest easy knowing you have a direct link to their current and previous whereabouts.

### Features

We define the CARETAKER as the user responsible for managing one or more PATIENT's, the user with Alzheimer’s.

The PATIENT can access:

- A simple map view with easy navigation to the list of important locations; because Google Maps complicated if you forget where you need to go
- An Augmented Reality overlay of their walking navigation; making it easier to follow directions by viewing the live overlay through the display
- An emergency button available to the patient that will automatically guide the patient home in the case of getting lost

The CARETAKER can access:

- Real-Time Location Access; in case they go missing
- Designation of “safe-zones” defined by the caretaker, in which the caretaker will be alerted when the patient enters or leaves these zones (such as the patient leaving or entering their home
- Push navigation instructions to patient
- Location History Trace; to see where they went
- Set a saved list of important locations; to add map makers like “home” or “grocery store”
- Generate daily report of patient location history

> I am a 4th year Computer Engineering student with an industry background primarily in
firmware. In addition to firmware, I have experience working with automation, regression
testing and build and CI. I have been exposed to the Apple development environment
before, having created a status-bar application for macOS.

#### Philip Leblanc
> paleblan@sfu.ca
> 
> I am a fourth-year computer engineering student with experience with c++, javascript,
python. Previously had a co-op at Simba technologies/ Magnitude Software on the Build
and Test Automation Team. Had me working on an internal webpage using Angular.js and
python but I am more comfortable with VS c++ through courses at sfu. Outside of school, I
enjoy soccer, hiking, and skiing.

### QA Developers:

#### Josh Shercliffe
